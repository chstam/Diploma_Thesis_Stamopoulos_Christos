Vibration-based Unsupervised Damage Detection on an Operating Wind Turbine using MISO-ARX Transmittance Functions and Multiple Model Based Methods

Present thesis attempts structural health of monitoring in a Vestas V27 wind turbine blade, via Stochastic Time Series Vibration-based methods under real operating and environmental 
conditions. Random stochastic acceleration measurements are acquired from 12 accelerometers placed in separate positions on the blade over a three-month period. 
The system is studied under a healthy state and three damaged ones, each considering a non-evolving crack of 15, 30 and 45 cm length respectively. These damages were 
artificially induced by creating the smallest one and letting it evolve naturally. The detection attempt of three damages is achieved through a parametric method of 
Multiple Models using four and five sensors. The experiment took place under variable Environmental and Operational Conditions (EOCs), as a result the available 
measurements has a significant level of uncertainty and noise hindering the detection problem. Nevertheless, cracks of 30 and 45 cm length are successfully detected 
with high true positive rates over low false alarms.
